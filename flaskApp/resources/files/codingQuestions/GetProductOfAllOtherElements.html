        Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each 
        element at index <em>i</em> of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array
        except the one at <em>i</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if out input was <em>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</em>, the expected output would be <em>[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]</em>. 
        If out input was <em>[3, 2 ,1]</em>, the expected output would be <em>[2, 3, 6]</em>.
